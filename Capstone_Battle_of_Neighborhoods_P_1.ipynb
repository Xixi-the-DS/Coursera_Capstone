Problem Description"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "A relatively new company recently successfully opened a store in New York, now wants to expand its second store to a different market. The company's store offers healthy (non-alcoholic) drinks and light food to people, both local and out of town vistors. Their product attracts all kinds of people with different ethnicities, different ages and different education backgrounds. The common trait is the people are conscious about health food or people want to try healthy food or drink.\n\nIts food or drink offering are a small store format with a few choices, similar to Jumba Juice. One of its ingredient of success is that store needs to be in a sufficient traffic area. So the first thing in the company's mind is to open the second store in a similar market, and they have decided to open in Toronto, Canada.\n\nThe first thing want to do is to decide on which neighborhood to open. They then will try to narrow down the particular location based on rental space availability and such real estate related issues. \n\nBecause their product attracts people with different demographics, there is not a set rules to determine which neighborhood to pick. They elected to consult with a data science service company to help them pick a few similar neighborhoods. They will then choose a location among those similar neighborhoods.\n\nThe data science consulting offered this idea to them. They will use K-means to group New Yorks neighborhoods and identify the kind of neighborhood the current store is in. Then they will find the same neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada by scoring the K-means model developed based on New York neighborhoods."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### B.
